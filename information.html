         <p class="p-info"> Our project is designed to develop a time based cartogram for the train system in Ireland. </p> 
         <p> The project allows the user to enter a station and time that they would like to travel at. Our system then takes in that information and displays the points of the train stations that they can travel to in one hop. </p> 
         <p> It then provides the user with two series of dots. The red dots shown represent where the stations are geographically located, and the green dots are moved either further or closer to the original station based on the time that it takes to reach that station.</p>
