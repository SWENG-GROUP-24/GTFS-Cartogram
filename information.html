         <p class="p-info"> Our project is designed to develop a time based cartogram for the 
             train system in Ireland. Our project allows the user to enter a station and time that 
             they would like to travel at. 
             Our system then takes in that information and displays the points of the train stations that they can 
             travel to in one hop. Our project provides the user with two series of dots. The red dots shown represent 
             where the stations are geographically located, and the green dots are moved either further or closer to the 
             original station based on the time that it takes to reach that station.
